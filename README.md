The purpose of the application is to create an application that allows daily prediction of oil stock prices. The application is designed to update the stock market data daily at 10:00 and create ML models to predict prices over a weekly horizon and save the data to a csv file for further analysis.
It also has a mode to call the application at any time of the day. The application is equipped with safeguards against lack of internet, in which case it retrieves data from a csv file. Once the prediction has been made, a second application "report.py" is called, which generates an interactive report page on localhost:8000.
